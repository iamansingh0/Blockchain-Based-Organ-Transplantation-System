# Blockchain Based Organ Transplantation System

In Collaboration with [@Japmann](https://github.com/JapmannKaur)

Blockchain Based Organ Transplantation System represents a prototype established as a proof-of-concept for an decentralized resolution. This application is constructed on the Ethereum platform, specifically utilizing Remix for the compilation and deployment of the smart contract. MetaMask operates as a wallet to facilitate the management of synthetic Ether supplied by Ganache. A JavaScript-based front-end interface application is developed to interact with the back-end through Web3.js.
